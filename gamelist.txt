(1) Needs samples provided separately



10 Yard Fight ("yard")
======================
Clones supported:
  Vs. version ("vsyard")

Known issues:
- Vs. mode runs only in cocktail mode (second player controls inverted).
  That's probably how the game is designed.



1942 ("1942")
=============
Clones supported:
  alternate version, almost identical ("1942a")
  another version ("1942b")

Known issues:
- Sometimes "1942a" ends in an endless loop over the sea, and the end of level
  boss doesn't appear. It hasn't been verified whether "1942" and "1942b" do the
  same; "1942" might be a later release that fixes this bug.



1943 ("1943")
=============
Known issues:
- Colors in test mode are not correct, but the board the PROMs were read from
  does the same. The colors in the game seem to be correct.
- To be able to access items 4-7 in the test menu, you must keep 3 pressed
  while pressing F3.



Aero Fighters ("aerofgt")
=========================
Keep button 1 pressed during boot to have access to a wider range of options
in service mode.



Amidar ("amidar")
=================
Clones supported:
  Japanese version ("amidarjp"). This version has a worse attract mode and
                                 does not display the number of jumps left.
  bootleg version called Amigo ("amigo")
  version running on Scramble hardware ("amidars")



Anteater ("anteater")
=====================
Known issues:
- cocktail mode doesn't work. This might well be a bug in the original.



Arabian ("arabian")
===================
In test mode, to test sound press 1 and 2 player start simultaneously.
2 players start + Button 1 will take you to the color test screen. Then hit
1 + Button 1 to go to the level test screen.  Button 1 will take you to the
next screen from then on.



Arkanoid ("arkanoid")
=====================
Clones supported:
  US version ("arknoidu")
  bootleg ("arkbl2")
  Tayto bootleg, not using the 68705 microcontroller ("arkatayt")

Known issues:
- Due to features of the 68705 not emulated yet, the "arkbl2" bootleg set
  doesn't work.
- There might also be protection related problems in "arknoidu" (later levels
  corrupted).
- Since it doesn't have to emulate the 68705, the Tayto bootleg is faster than
  the other versions.
- Dual paddle in cocktail mode is not supported.



Armored Car ("armorcar")
========================
Press the second player button #2 (default: S) + F3 to enter test mode

Clones supported:
  alternate version ("armorca2")



Astro Blaster ("astrob")
========================
Clones supported:
  version 1 ("astrob1")
To quote from Clay Cowgill's page ( http://wwwpro.com/clay/roms_stuff.html )
about the version 1 ROMs:

This ROM set appears to be the "original" Astro Blaster ROMs. There are no
on-screen instructions and the progression of waves is very difficult. I
believe they were replaced by version 2 (below) to make the game a little
easier. The game behaves a little differently than version 2 when starting
up-- the more coins you put in, the more ships you get to start with.



Atari Basketball ("bsktball")
=============================
The original hardware uses the Player 1 and Player 2 Start buttons
as the Jump/Shoot buttons.  I've taken button 1 and mapped it to the Start
buttons to keep people from getting confused.



Astro Fighter ("astrof")
========================
	Astro Fighter Sets:

    The differences are minor. From newest to oldest:

	Main Set: 16Kbit ROMs
	          Green/Hollow empty fuel bar.
			  60 points for every bomb destroyed.

	Set 2:    8Kbit ROMs
			  Blue/Solid empty fuel bar.
			  60 points for every bomb destroyed.

	Set 3:    8Kbit ROMs
			  Blue/Solid empty fuel bar.
			  300 points for every seven bombs destroyed.

Known issues:
- The background is blue. It was black in all the original boards checked, but
  there is no obvious bug in the emulation.



Bagman ("bagman")
=================
Clones supported:
  Stern license ("bagmans")
  other Stern license, older ("bagmans2")



Battlezone ("bzone")
====================
Clones supported:
  alternate version ("bzone2")

There are two control methods:
  1) E,I,D,K,Space: Close to the original controls (two up/down sticks)
  2) Arrow keys+CTRL: simulates a 4-way joystick



Berzerk ("berzerk")
===================
Clones supported:
  earlier, very rare version ("berzerk1")



Black Tiger ("blktiger")
========================
Clones supported:
  Japanese version, Black Dragon ("blkdrgon")
  bootleg version ("bktigerb")
  bootleg Black Dragon with the protection removed and hacked to say "Black
    Tiger" on the title screen ("blkdrgnb")



Blaster ("blaster")
===================
The first time you run the game, it will say "factory settings restored".
Press F2 to proceed.

F2 tests
F1+F2 bookkeeping/setup



Blood Bros. ("bloodbro")
========================
Press button 3 + F3 to enter service mode.



Bomb Jack ("bombjack")
======================

In the dip switch menu, DIFFICULTY 1 refers to the speed of the mechanical
bird, while DIFFICULTY 2 to the number and speed of enemies.

Return of the jedi ("jedi")
===========================

  not emulated.

Clones supported:
  alternate version, older ("rthundrb")

(set2), called 'old version' in japan.(1986/12)
(set1), called 'new version' in japan.(1987/1)
In 1987/1, All 'old version' romset changed 'new version' in amusement center.
because (i think) 'old version' was overdone that too hard difficulty game.

  alternate version. This has a typo on the title screen: ALL RIGHT RESERVED
    instead of ALL RIGHT*S* RESERVED. ("rygar2")
  Japanese version ("rygarj")

  to simulate the tree visible on the flyer.
  The flyer is at www.gamearchive.com/flyers/video/segagremlin/safari_b.jpg



Scion ("scion")
===============
Clones supported:
  Cinematronics license ("scionc")

Known issues:
- scion has some constant background noise. scionc doesn't. This might be due
  to a bad ROM.

======================
Clones supported:
  alternate version, probably earlier ("snowbroa")

In snowbroa, you sometimes get a green potion that makes you invincible for a
few seconds (during which you can pass through walls and destroy any enemies
you touch). I looked at the GFX for this set vs snowbros and it appears that
only the snowbroa set has it.

Invaders hardware.

proceed through all the configuration screens, or just reset (F3).
To change the language afterwards, delete the SDUNGEON.HI file from the HI

  again you have to delete SDUNGEON.HI.
- At game over, you are sent back to service mode.

- Red screen "flash" when you die is not supported

F2 tests
F1+F2 bookkeeping/setup



Star Jacker ("starjack")
========================
Clones supported:
  Stern copyright ("starjacs")

The Stern version allows to play both in "multi" and "single" mode. The Sega
version is hardcoded for "multi" mode.

Known issues:
- Sprites in the Stern version might be wrong - I'm using the ROMs from the
  Sega version because the other ones were bad.



Star Wars ("starwars")
======================
The dip switches only have effect when the EEPROM is invalid (that is, when
there is no starwars.hi file). Afterwards, settings can be changed in the
service menu.

Known issues:
- Sometimes, after the TIE level, instead of zooming into the Death Star the
  game sits there endlessly.



Strategy X ("stratgyx")
=======================
Stern version

Clones supported:
  bootleg, probably of the Konami version, different ("stratgyb")

Known issues:
- Dip switches not verified, especially in the bootleg version



Subs ("subs")
=============
This game uses two monitors, one for each player, aimed away from each
other.  The emulation displays both monitors side by side on the screen.  A
lot of the challenge is lost when you can see both monitors.  Unfortunately,
there is no other simple solution to allow 2-player support on a
single-monitor computer.  Also, Subs is mildly dependent on its overlay.
Without the overlay, it might not be obvious that the playfield is circular
in shape, and the blinking white box actually illuminates a box labelled
"Sonar".



Sunset Riders ("ssriders")
==========================
To enter service mode, hit F2 while the game is in attract mode. Make sure to
go in the game options and enable stereo sound.



Super Basketball ("sbasketb")

Super Cobra ("scobra")
======================
Stern copyright.

====================
Clones supported:
  bootleg version ("pangb")
  Buster Bros ("bbros")

The bootleg version contains opcodes and data decrypted separately, plus a few
patches here and there. They disabled sound in attract mode (there isn't a
setting to do that, unlike Buster Bros), changed the lives option from 1,2,3,4
to 1,3,4,6, and changed the copyright year from 1989 to 1990.



Super Pang ("spang")
====================
The first time you start the game, keep 1 pressed until you see the "SUPER
PANG 900914 ETC" screen, otherwise it won't initialize properly. This is
needed only the first time, the setup is saved to the EEPROM after that.



Super Qix ("superqix")
======================
Clones supported:
  bootleg version ("sqixbl")

Known issues:
- Speed is wrong (much too slow)
- Sprite flipping is not emulated.
- Due to protection, the original version doesn't work. Use the bootleg instead.



Super Zaxxon ("szaxxon")
========================
Known issues:
- Several people complained that it runs too fast. This is not the case: a real
  board has been verified and it behaves the same. It's just insanely
  difficult.



T.M.N.T. 2 ("tmnt2")
====================
To enter service mode, hit F2 while the game is in attract mode. Make sure to
go in the game options and enable stereo sound.



Tempest ("tempest")
===================
Clones supported:
  version 2 ("tempest2")
  version 1 ("tempest1")
  Tempest Tubes ("temptube")

Known issues:
- Several people complained that mouse control is reversed. This is not the
  case. The more obvious place where this can be seen is the level selection
  screen at the beginning: move the mouse right, the block goes right.
  Anyway, if you don't like the key assignments, you can change them.



Terra Cresta ("terracre")
=========================
Clones supported:
  alternate version using YM2203 instead of YM3526 ("terracra")

  Hyper Olympic ("hyprolym")
  Hyper Olympic bootleg which uses a 6802 + ADPCM samples instead of the
    VLM5030 speech chip ("hyprolyb")



Turbo Force ("turbofrc")
========================
Known issues:
- The front scrolling layer is completely wrong. You can see the title and
  American flag correctly only due to a hack. Everything else is wrong. The
  only explanation I have for this is a missing gfx ROM.
  To toggle the front layer off and on, press the space bar. You'll need to
  in later levels otherwise you won't see the background and some enemies.



Turkey Shoot ("tshoot")
=======================
The first time you run the game, it will say "factory settings restored".
Press F2 to proceed.

F2 tests
F1+F2 bookkeeping/setup



Turtle Ship ("turtship")
========================
Known issues:
- dip switches not mapped
- part of the gfx tiles are not used by the video driver, therefore the
  background is probably wrong in later levels.



Turtles ("turtles")
===================
Clones supported:
  Turpin ("turpin")
  600 (Konami version with different gameplay) ("600")

Known issues:
- Colors in 600 might be wrong.



Twin Cobra ("twincobr")
=======================
Clones supported:
  Romstar license ("twincobu")
  Kyukyoku Tiger ("ktiger")

Known issues:
- Most enemies appear already destroyed. This is probably caused by the
  incomplete emulation of the protection microcontroller.
- Kyukyoku Tiger doesn't boot.



Two Tigers ("twotiger")
=======================
Known issues:
- Two players not well supported



Us vs Them ("usvsthem")
=======================

By default, the driver runs in cocktail mode.



Who Dunit ("whodunit")
======================
Keep button 1 pressed at boot to skip the checks.
Keep start pressed to enter service mode.



Wizard of Wor ("wow")
=====================
The original machine had a special joystick which could be moved either
partially or fully in a direction. Pushing it slightly would turn around the
player without making it move. The emulator assumes that you are always
pushing the joystick fully, to simulate the "half press" you can press Alt.



Wonder Boy ("wboy")
===================
Clones supported:
  alternate version - harder! ("wboy2")
  another version with different encryption ("wboy3")
  another version with different encryption. The music in this version is
    higher pitched. ("wboy4")
  same as above, but not encrypted. The sound ROM is the "standard" one, not
    the higher pitched one. ("wboy4u")
  unencrypted version, different from the others - earlier? ("wboyu")
  Wonder Boy Deluxe - this seems to be a bootleg of wboy4, it is not encrypted
    but is almost identical apart from removed ROM checksums and the "Energy
	Consumption" dip switch. ("wbdeluxe")

Known issues:
- I haven't decoded wboy3 yet.



World Cup 90 ("wc90")
=====================
Clones supported:
  bootleg version ("wc90b")

Known issues:

There are no dip switches, press F1 to enter the service mode, then
  F1      Next screen
  F2      Next line
  F5      Up
  F6      Down

The first time you run the game, it will ask the location. You can change the
name using F5/F6 and F2, then F1 to proceed through all the configuration
screens, or just reset (F3).
